this is a simple frequency analysis algo that looks to see if there is a normalized distribution in the Trimet Day codes. 
The total maximum pairs for a 2 day, day code, out of 8 total characters is 28 (quite possibly the minimum days in a month). 
This is an ongoing attempt to crack the code and part of a much smaller subset of attempts.
